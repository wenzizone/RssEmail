    a awesome maskcomes with a visor which is good for outdoorsnever fogs uplooks okay 

    A God-send to shooters! What used to be hours running patches through the bore has been reduced to, at most, 2 passes with the bore snakeI usually scrub with a brush first before I use the snake...this probably isnt necessary, but Im still in denial that gun cleaning can be this easyI also like to put some Hoppe's on the flossI highly recommend having a bore snake for each caliber you have! 

    A great shoe for meI have been troubled with heel spurs, but with this shoe and a little stretching I'm okay

    A GREAT SHOE FOR THE PRICETHE SHOE IS VERY COMFORTABLE AND LIGHTWEIGHTI WAS ALSO IMPRESSED BY THE QUICK DELIVERY OF THE SHOES

    A great utility knifeI carried this knife with me during a year in IraqKept a sharp blade with little maintenance and the lock did not foul in the sandHowever, I felt a but concerned about the strength of the tipAlthough I did not break it I treated this portion of the knife with careMaye the drop point version would have been a better choiseHandle always worked well, no matter the temperature

    A very decent survival knife for the moneyIt is quite big and heavy with good built qualityThe sheath has three pouches for the supplied gear which is pretty sufficient I recon, but still had to add a Swedish steel fire starter for completionI also took the hand guard off and wrapped around a tennis grip which really helped out to give the grip a little bit more rugged feelAt the end of the day I am very satisfied with the purchase

    A word of warningThe metal on these tents cannot support any kind of rain at allOn our first use, our tent collapsed during a rainstorm, with no less than four of the metal supports shearing right throughSome of the supports poked through the canopy itselfThe warranty specifically states that "This warranty does not apply to damages caused by wind, rain, or other forces of nature"In other words, if you ever use the tent outdoors, and it gets damaged, the warranty is VOID.On another note, this tent was standing directly next to an older tent from another manufacturer, and that tent survived the rain with no damage whatsoever

    Accurate, works well, only problem I've had is it times out and I have accidently reset it to zero when I try to bring up the display

    After I bought this firesteel, I was very anxious to try it outI tried probably over 100 times, and I could only get a spark every timeThe spark was bright, and it was pretty hot, but it wouldnt light anythingI tried paper, a block of wood, and a bundle of dry grassI don't think I am using this right, you may have to use that special "Mayadust" that is manufactered by the same companyBut, I doubt that armies would use this if you had to have Mayadust in order to light a fire

    After reviewing the size chart on Vibram's website, I went to the local store prepared to purchaseWhen I told him what size Vibram recommended, he smirked in disbeliefI tried on the Vibram's Web recommended size and then tried what the salesman recommendedSure enough, Vibram's recommendation felt a bit small to meEven though a size bigger had a little breathing room, I found it to be a little more comfortableIn addition, consideration of the activity the FiveFingers will be used for should have great precedenceI'm not running, distance or otherwise, in them so extra room isn't a problemThis is an item I would recommend finding locally and trying on before orderingYour preferred fit may differ from mineI'm eager to hear other opinions.Aside from sizing, I love the productI've never owned any toe separating footwear but wasn't/am not deterred by the Vibram design one bitThey are quite comfortable just wearing around, indoors and outI will add more info about how they do on the Hawaii shores when I take them outThe original reason I purchased these was for use as reef shoes; fishing and recreationThe KSO's design that covers the top of the foot is expected to keep sand out, at least more than the SprintI'll let you know

    After seeing more and more people, especially children, become more and more lazy every day, it's nice to see a product that promotes physical activity and gives you the motivation to get startedMy two nephews are competing against each other to see who can get 60 minutes of activity firstI use it when I go to the gym and will spend time joggin around the block just to fill up all my bars! It tells the time, date and your activity accumulatedIt's very comfortable and just as durable as the live strong bands plus it gives you rewards for movinggreat product 

    all good - tells the time, some stuff about the moon and tides - temperature is pretty pointless as the heat from your wrist messes things upTheres a handy function where the back light turns on when you tilt your wristOnly problem is the backlight only stays on for a second and you cant hold the button in to keep it on longer 

    An excellent shoe for the price...I wear them into the office as an excellent casual shoe...and I have found there is no need to change to walking shoes for when we go for an hour long walk over the lunch periodI like them when traveling as easy off and back on again when going through the TSA screening and to take back off again on those long overseas flightsMy last pair lasted six years, and I have just ordered a replacement pair today

    Anything I do not have to apply to my skin and keeps away the bugs makes me a happy camper! It even repelled meat bees and flies while we ate lunch in Yellowstone

    Are kids bought us 2canopy chairs we go to a lot of softball games and the canopy was a very good ideal but after the 5th week the plastic straps holding the canopy fell apart and made the canopy worthless i read some reviews one review gave a phone number to call 1 800 328 6166 I called the number talked to a lady she was aware of the problem took my name address told me they would send me 2 replacement chairs in 5 to 10 days I got my chairs in 5 days the good thing is they replaced the plastic with canvas straps good ideal would recommend to buy this product 5 stars ROBERT JACOBS TONGANOXIE KANSAS 

    Are rangefinders a great thing for golf? Yes, they areIs this the rangefinder you want? NOI had an old bushnell that I loved- right up until someone stole it from my cartI could not find a used one like it, so I opted to purchase a medalist, from someone on e-bayI thought I'd spend the extra money to get the "pin-seeker" technologyFirst, this model does not work a bit better than my old oneIn fact, I generally find that it has a harder time finding the pin, not an easier oneAnd then there's the cover for the battery....It arrived with the cover off, which should have been my first clueIt would not snap on, and it took about a gram's worth of pressure for it to fall off- without un-latching itI took it to a local golf store, and they were willing to exchange itI used the new one today, and the cover fell off 4x during the round, just sitting in the golf cartYou can tape it on, but I don't think you should have to duct-tape something that is $250It's a very poor design, to have the cover piece fit over a curveThe case for it looks like it cost bushnell about 10 cents to make, and was sewn by a blind man....- pretty disconcerting for such an expensive gadgetI love having a rangefinder, but I am extremely disappointed that bushnell has such poor quality controlI only wish I had purchased it on , because then i could send it back! 

    Arthritis gloves, the gloves are an answer to achy handsThey both warm and support the joints in my hands, 

    As Promised and On Time - Product appears solid and stands and works well

    At the recommendation of my Chiropractor, I purchased a large exercise ball at Target, but  has them tooI got the 65 cm version, which is recommended for people of height 5' 7" - 6' 1".With it you can do all kinds of stretches that are not possible otherwiseSince using it, much of my ongoing back pain has disappearedOne of my favorites is to place it against my back, facing the ceiling, and gently roll onto it until my outstretched hands touch the floorI can just rest there and feel an incredible stretch from my hips to my neckReversing that stretch, you can lay on it stomach down, and rest your forehead on your forearmsThe ball gives gently as you roll on itAs we age, our spines need stretching more then ever, and I can't recommend this product enough.Also, as the name implies, "exercise ball" you can do all kinds of things with it, but the stretching I'm doing on it has given me great relief.Just make sure you get the one with the HAND PUMP, not the foot pump, which is worthless

    Bad points, your hand gets tired quickly pumping 100 times to fill a lawn tractor gas tankTo make matters worse, the safety catch requires your other hand in a awkward position to disengage it.Good points, throw away all your old gas containers and never have to lift, pour and spill gas all over the tractor ever again

    Barbells are a quality productLook good and I'm getting a workout in the pool

    Barska? AR-15 / M16 Electro Scope Matte Black FinishI ordered this scope and was very satisified with the itemI mounted scope to a Colt Sporter and had very good resultsGood itemThanks WPN 

    Baskets are strong and functionalHave to make adjustments if your rack is not metal, otherwise they are great

    Before buying this product, I viewed the installation video, just to make sense of the designI purchased the 2-bike model, which has a single support that rests on the trunk, and 2 supports on the bumperI mounted it quickly on my passatI made a short test run, and found it stable , and easily unmouted, and remountedI had no problem dismounting it, and rotating the arms to store in the trunk, while I rodeEven though my recumbent bike has a different frame, I was able to adjust to carry the bike, although more fiddling would be required to carry 2 bikes

    Before I actually used the Ultimate Progym in a bagI believed that the only way one can effectively do resistance training is with a good set of weights or use the professional equipment in a gymWell in my case desperate times call for desperate measuresI have been on the road for work during the past year and could not make use of my gym membershipThe workout equipment available to me was questionableSo I decided to try this product thinking that at least I would be doing somethingWell not only was I doing something, I was doing a lot of somethingBy using this equipment and eating right I lost 30 lbs in 5 monthsThese tubes are awesome! I can do just about any exercise I could do with free weightsThe best part is that I can work my body to failure without the fear of dropping the bar on myselfMy experience with the company has also been excellent, when a band snap after some over use, they replaced it for me for freeI was considering buying a high priced body weight machine but after using these tubes those machines are not worth itThe only critism I have is that I cannot buy an additional 20 lb tubeIf they made a 20 lb clip on tube this product would be perfectI highly recommend it

    Before purchasing this item, I used a hand pad and regular handwraps to work out on my heavy bag; Now, I almost can't bear to use the traditional handwraps! They cushion and support my hands perfectly, allowing me to switch from traditional boxing to open-hand bag strikes without worrying about hurting my wrist from a lack of supportTwo notes of caution, however: 1They don't cover the finger knuckles very well, so it is probably a good idea to invest in some tape to cover these spots, and 2If you are hard on these gloves, they will tear open at the seamsBut hey, for $20, you wouldn't expect to have them last forever, right? 

    Believe it or not this device actually works! Maybe that is why J&J can not make it fast enough? 

    Best shoes I've ever hadI can't give them enough starsIf you're a larger than average person, do your feet a favor and get these shoes

    Better than the originalI have the RS800SDI was afraid that this strap would not work with my wear link sensor but it snapped right on no problemThis strap is more comfortable than the original! 

    Beware of Sportsmans Guide! Their customer service sucks and Customer Service Garrantee is WORTHLESS! Save yourself a lot of greif spend a few more bucks and buy elsewhere! 

    Bought these as a gift for my boyfriendClubs arrived promptlyHe's taken them out a few times and raves about themHe is a beginner golfer so this was a great set for the price

    BOUGHT THESE OARS SO WE CAN NAVIGATE OUR LAKE IN OUR 8' ROUND INFLATABLEWE BRING THEM ON THE PADDLEBOAT,TOOGOOD THING THEY FLOAT! THEY'RE JUST THE RIGHT LENGTH AND ARE WELL MADE

    Bought this BB gun for my 22 year old Newphew for Christmas as that is what he asked forSounds to me like he loves it! 

    Bought this for my wifeI figured the good reviews outweighed the bad onesI was wrongIt completely fell apart after a couple of weeks of her using itDon't waste your money like I did

    Bought this product on Oct 22 2007I was 182 LbsMostly needed to reduce abdomen fatToday 19 Dec 2007I am 164 Lbslost 2 inches already.This device alone cannot do this magicI read the booklet that came with it firstNo more chips/cookies/coffee Or riceNo suar intake eitherI also runs couples of miles 3 times a weekand eat protein rich dietDon't expect to work out just 3 minutes a day and lose poundsIt also demands other physical activities and healthy diet

    Bought this tent for my son as he is now a webelo and no longer gets to sleep in my tentWe went to a summer webelos camp and experienced 2 days of Florida summer downpoursThe tent stayed bone dryI seam sealed the tent before I left but wonder if it was even needed.I would buy this tent again

    brings back old memories.Bought it for grandchild.He loves it plenty of room and easy to install on bike, Very sturdy 

    Brought these clubs for my husband in 2007...well his first or second outing to the driving range one of the heads flew off!!! The company immediately sent him a new one although it was not the same brand as the one I brought but they did respond very quicklyI did not want to spend a lot on some clubs for my husband since he had never played so I did not know if he would like the gameOkay clubs for beginners

    Can't really add much to the previous reviews - this works greatCan add, however, that it will work on an Armalite 6.8 Rem Spc magazine

    Classic BootHandles great, quality constructionReally comfortableI really like the simplicity of the style, not to muchGreat traction on the pitch great ball control

    Clear descriptions and options for purchasingVery efficient, fast delivery and top quality goods - thank you! 

    Columbia Sportswear Men's Cathedral Peak VestI ordered two of these, one grey and one Tusk colorI really like the TuskThese run a little bit small and should have just a bit more length to themI'm 6'3" tall and normally an extra large works fine for me, but not in this vestI would have ordered an extra large Tall, but they don't come in the Tall size.I really like the fleece feel and the two outside zipper pocket, but it would be nice if they had an inside pocket, like Columbia puts on the inside of their Cougar Peaks outerwear

    Considering it still being winter, there has not been any use of this productThe excitement that came from the recievers of the gift was excited to use itI was told I would not get it by Christmas, but Christmas eve, there it was on the front stepIt came 5 days quicker than originally scheduled

    Could have bought the watch at Wal Mart without the shipping charge for approximately the same amount

    Definitely professional grade, unlike what I had beforeInstructions are easy and complete, ball is perfect for exercising, stretching, pilates and core and strength trainingIt is everything it was advertised to be

    Delivery of product was faster than expectedProduct is used by my wife who has chronic back problemsIt works fine! 

    Directional readings are accurate enough to navigate by, but not as accurate as watches costing four times as much.It has lots of useful features like, alarm, countdown timer, and chronograph

    Do not try to save a few dollars buying this rackShipping will cost you anyway and the rack is not worth the few dollars it costIt would not mount on my bike due to not having the proper hardware includedMy wife's bike has the single center hole this rack MUST have to be mounted, but the metal piece that connects the rack to the hole on the bike is not long enough so the rack can not be mounted levelThe short attachment piece means it is tipped quite a bit forward of levelTipped a few degrees forward might be good, but this is tipped WAY forward and is as far back as the piece allows.Also, the rack comes with 4 bolts and two nutsYou might think one bolt and nut to connect the bar to the bike, one bolt and nut to connect the front of the rack to the bar, and two bolts to thread into the holes right above where the rear tire connectsIf they fit, that might workThe two bolt without nuts were too small to thread into the bike frameThe bolt and nut was too short to reach through the hole to connect the "bar" to the bike frame below the seat..Out of 4 bolts, only 1 could possibly be used so when thinking about the price of this rack add in the cost of a trip to the hardware or bike store to get bolts that actually workWhat a waste of timeYou get what you pay for with this rackA CHEAP piece of junk

    Do you want warm feet in the frozen northeast? These are the socks for youNot only warm but they also last a very long timeAfter years of washing they are just as good as newWell worth the cost

    Do you watch your child play sports? Do you picnic or hike outside? Do you go to outdoor concerts? Do you hang out at the lake or beach? You totally need this! It pops up in seconds and gives you great sun shade while also offering a cross-breeze through the windowsWhen you are finished, you just fold it back down againI use mine at my daughters soccer games, it makes those hot sunny games so much more bearable! 

    does not fit greenline beach bikes.I installed one on a mountain bike,found it to be noisy,except at low speeds

    Dont bother buying these, the seams tear WAY too easyIf you are just looking for something good loking to show off, these are itBut any serious bag work and the seams splitOn the good side, these feel really nice on the hands 

    Don't hesitate to buy one, using it in the field while hunting was fantasticTurn it off - get covered in mosquitoes, turn it on - can't even tell that there are any around

    Don't waste money or time on this itemI wouldn't even give it any stars if that were an optionRight cylinder was faulty from the startThere was about a 1/4" gap before any resistance kicked in on the right stepAfter less than one month, resistance in right step gave out 20 minutes into my workout - 10 minutes into my husband'sWithin 7 weeks from purchase, well within the 90-day warranty, we contacted Team 6 to request replacement partWe were told they did not have the part in stock and they would ship the part when their warehouse received itWhen we pressed for a commitment to a date for this to happen, they would not give oneSince they refused to commit to a shipping date, we requested a replacement unit and they refused that alsoWe tried to work with them through another email, but they stopped communicating with usAfter several weeks, we called the 1-800 number, and were told that the parts were made in China and it would take a week for them to get hereHMMMWe started this process about 4-6 weeks before we were told over the phone that it would take a week for them to get the part! We again told them this was not acceptable, were put through to a "Manager", and got a voicemailBig surpriseWe left our informationThat phone call was a week ago, still no replacement part, no unit, and no serviceIf you can afford a more expensive one, make the investment in your health and do itAlso, the problem exacerbated my knee pain because of the uneven resistanceWe bought a StairMaster and my knee is fine

    Easily the best watch I've every ownedI really like the feel of the metal bandThe atomic synchronization works every nightIt's packed with great featuresLove it! 

    Easy to hold and work withGood resistance and gripExcellent workout prop

    EASY TO INSTALL EVEN WITHOUT INSTRUCTIONSHAS WORKED GREAT SO FAR, IT IS ALL PLASTIC WHICH SUCKS BUT FOR 6 DOLLARS PLUS SHIPPING ITS WELL WORTH ITJUST MAKE SURE THAT NOTHING IS BINDING UP OR YOU WILL BRAKE IT 

    Enjoy the MatQuality, smell fades, comfortable, non slip and thickThe extra length is key for taller peeps- hence i had to order another for the ladySo it is a bit pricey but if you're serious about your practice well worth it

    Every kid deserves at least one Red Ryder under the Christmas tree at some point in their lifeBeyond the fun of plinking cans and paper plates, it's a great way to introduce youngsters to firearms safety.They aren't made to high standards, it is a kids toy after all, but the ones I've had were able to take lots of abuse

    Every once in while a product does what it saysThis is one of those productsCuts load and unload times down and is extremely simple to useSo maybe no one needs it but everyone should have oneOutstanding product

    every stair stepper you look for nowadays is really big and insanely expensiveI had one for years that folded up like this one, but one of the hydraulics was going out, so we figured we'd need to find a replacementThis does the job well for the price paid; it's nice to be able to stash this out of the way so you don't have exercise equipment dominating a room in your house

    Everything works well and is well designed about this computer except the thermometerIt is only accurate in the shadeWhen it hits the sun it will be 5 to 10 degrees too warmOtherwise having so many functions on one screen is wonderfulEverthing else works flawlessly! For the price, you can overlook the temp problem and park the bike in the shade to get good readings or use the readings for better war stories.Would be nice to create a wireless version and make the sensor less sensitive to sun

    Excellent Product -Bit Kit for LeathermanAs usual a quality Leatherman product from a quality supplier

    Excellent Product for Outdoor Military Duty in heat exceding 110 DegreesBest choice of all Under Armour products for use as underwear in extreme high and cold tempearture environments

    Excellent product received few days before promissed dateIt is exactly what I had expected

    Extremely user-friendly, does not come loose when firing as other sights sometimes doUsual adjustments for the vertical and horizontal planes and the look of an ACOG give the weapon a more tactical, personalized look

    Fantastic flashlight, BUT, please note that the clip is upside down from what you would expectIf you want to carry this in a shirt pocket, the flashlight will be pointed up and out of your pocketReturned for the LX2 model that has a bi-directional clip

    Far better than other exercise balls I've ownedThe plastic is thick so the ball holds its shape -- doesn't get soft and lose its elasticity over time as other balls I've owned haveI would definitely recommend it! 

    Feel goodLook goodI don't run but i work 12 hour shifts on my feet and they hold up very wellRecommend highly

    FIRST ONE LASTED 5 MINS BURNT UP SECOND ONE LASTER 5 DAYS STOPPED WORKING DON'T BUY WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY PIECE OF JUNK 

    Five LED lights together on the bill of a hat may look ridiculous but actually does a dccent jobI use the lights to read by since my middle age eyes require a lot of light to readFive lights are better than one although the light still doesn't radiate across the entire verticle page of the bookThe price is excellent and I would recommend the product as good for reading but not perfect

    For me nothing cleans better with the added benefit of also been very fastThis is as good as advertised

    For the money, this is an excellent pedometerVery reliable, with basic functions and some added features as well5-day memory comes in handyCounts very well

    For the price, this bag is greatMost bags in stores and online were 4" in width, and will not accomodate my daughter's carry-home books each dayThis bag is 6" plus

    For these goggles to be air tight, kids need to be olderThe little nose of a 4 year old make it impossible to keep the water out

    Good fit and colorDid not like the front liner though; held water and slowed drying timeSome careful work with scissors solved the problemSide panel measures 2 inches not 1 inchDon't understand the seam in the back either but found it not to be a problem in any wayWas able to get at great price also, so I purchased extrasAll in all, really like the suit and recommend it

    Good shelter, tried it out as a shower this weekendOnly problem was dressing after a shower, no room for keeping clothes dryGood head room though 

    Good shoes for everyday wearI would not recommend working out in these shoes, especially if you are and under-pronatorThere is extra inner arch support that would benefit those who need it

    Good valueIndestructableGreat 1 liter size for monitoring your daily water intake

    Great addition to take along on your next camping tripExtra tent stakes always come in handyThe only item missing is a small tent repair kit, but that can be added easily.You will probably pay more if you try to purchase all of these items separately

    Great baskets that fold up totally out of the wayWhen they're closed, you don't even really notice themHad to add longer screws though, as the ones they supply were not long enough to secure it to my rear rackNot a problem thoughGreat racks for the money

    Great hammockWent camping for 5 days with 8 people, all ages and sizes, and it held up greatDont need the stand, still comfy tied right to a treeAnd the colors aren't THAT bad...looked good camping

    Great price on a quailty itemArrived quickly..fit great.How can you go worn on a skechers product

    Great product, easy operation and provides great sun relief for my puppy and for usWould buy again.....thank you 

    Great productWish it would close tighter against the gun's to keep them from shifting better but the foam isn't quite dense enough for thatAll in all, as gun/pistol cases go it get's the job done

    Great seller, but the shirt that i received is in diferent color than the image 

    great starter set you will be able to get a good grasp of the game with this set and what a deal 

    great value - i love the no-blowing-inside-out advantage of the umbrella,, and i like the classic look

    G-Shock Big Combination Military Watch - Matte BlackThe digital display is not near as bright as appears in photoI don't know of any way to adjust brightness or contrast

    Had one for twenty years and finally wore outBought this one because it is exactly the same as the old one I hadI go with the quality of Victorinox, and not some other knockoff brands which I have owned and always regretted buying

    had watch for almost 2 yrs now..kept perfect time and also temp..till i learned how to use other feature,,now i know when a full moon and high tides are..pretty cool 

    Happy I bought the product I think it is well worth itIt does work

    Have used this headlamp in overnight sailing racesThe red light makes it nice as you don't lose your night visionAlso used it quite a bit on an island off the coast of HondurasThey didn't have power on the island for the whole time we were there so it made making your way around at night easyGreat buy! 

    Have you been thinking about buying Jrsomething for his church camp? Or maybe you wanted to scare off door-to-door salesmen? This is the product for you! This mean looking knife includes a cavity you can stuff with useful items like a tiny sewing needle and some thread for stitching your wounds when a real man cuts you up with his real knifeThe blade is made of durable stainless steel that won't actually hold an edge no matter how much you use the cheap sharpening stone includedThe lame plastic handle is likely to bust in a real jam and the clunky saw teeth might cut a wet noodle! And the best is definitely last: there is NO tang! That's right; if you wedge this blade between to wet paper sacks, it will bust right off causing serious bodily injuryTake that Gerber ASEK! If you want a knife, open your kitchen drawerIf you want a GRADE A toy that's best left in the garbage, this is the right one for you! 

    Haven't tried them in open water yet, but in the pool they were greatNot as "big" as I expected - not like swimming in diving goggles - very snug fit and a great seal

    He cambiado la bateria en dos oportunidades en un ano y medio, esto con las funciones de iluminacion encendidas, excepto por esto es un gran reloj.I changed the battery twice in a little more than a yearAnyway is a great watch

    Hello allI haven't tried the product yet and I am very excited about using it but ordering from beachbody has been a nightmareI should have paid more attention to the reviews from this site and ordered from People have been so right about them overcharging you for products and getting you to order things that you didn't want in the first placeIt's too bad that good products like this, P90X and other beachbody products have to be a part of a company that is out for your money and awful costumer serviceI guess lesson learned but if you can get the same thing from this site or ebay DO IT!!! 

    Hello.I am a EMT student.This is very well builtThe light is very bright, maybe a little too bright when I'm shining it in people eyesIt comes with a little slip-on guard to narrow the light, it is nice to have, but slipps off sometimesThe light is very thin, and the clip moves up and down, making it fit good in your shirt pocketI will say that the AAAA batteries are allitle abnormal, But Radio Shack and Wal-Greens have them.This light is worth the 15 or so dollars._TRV 

    Hey, this little bb gun looks swell with it's sleek black barrel and wooden butt and pump/gripI bought it to shoot at cans in my back yardAnd, it is adequate, but not a terrific amount of funIt got a wonderful writeup by a seller on gunbroker.comHowever..It is not easy to load bbs into the small hole and, often, many are spilledYou will have to adjust to the pumpThe first few times, I squeezed my fingersThe chambering device is not terrificIt is almost necessary to hold the toy upside down to insure that a bb goes into the chamberFinally, the wooden butt stock is held into place by one screw, not two or moreThis allows the butt to wiggle from side to side when it is not constantly retightenedIt rather makes me upset that highly paid Crosman execs make tons of money, but never try out their own product

    Hmm...it's already been four months and I used it about three weeks before my real bed arrivedFirst, if you consider this as a substitution of a real bed, consider it againIt could be used temporarily, not recommended for permanent useMy wife told me you might get your back hurt if you keep sleeping over itSecond, I think the air bed itself is pretty goodThe surface material feels goood, and built-in AC pump works fineThe noise while pumping up the bed is kind of disturbing, but it's tolerableHowever, you have to hear that noise repeatedly because the air keeps flowing out little by littleSo you have to feed it once 3~4 daysI have it currently, and I think I can set it up for my friends visiting and staying over my house
